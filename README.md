# B351_FinalProject
INTRODUCTION

This is Jackson Miller and Aidan Molina's Final Project source code for CSCI-B 351 Introduction to AI. Our program is designed to compared two different algorithms specifically a backtracking and a mathematical approach algorithm. This was done by solving nonogram puzzles and comparing the time complexity.

DEPENDENCIES

At the start of the program we import the time and the enumerator which are already built into python so there is no need to install anything

RUNNING THE PROGRAM

Open the Board.py preferebly in VSC and the main method is already set up so the all that needs to be done is to compile and run the program.
